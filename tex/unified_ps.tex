    \section{Leveraging existing infrastructure to build a Quantum Network}
    \section{Resource Allocation and Economical analysis}

    Given a quantum network as described in the previous section, we wish to devise a scheme of resource allocation within the network that is practically efficient. Thus, we may determine the relative importances of different components of the network, viz. nodes and links, and ascertain a framework for monetary compensation in exchange for a Quantum network service.
    
    We use the QL Specification from section 1. Refer to \texttt{part\_3.pdf} for the full analysis.
